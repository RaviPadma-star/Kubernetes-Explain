created a folder called configmap under created the configmap.yaml file
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubernates-demo
data:
  # this is key value pair
  course: kubernates
  durarion: 25hr
  time: 7pm
  date: 26-aug


next git pull in server
go cd configmap then create a pod
    -- kubectl apply -f 01-ConfigMap.yaml
then how we get the configmap resources
    -- kubectl get configmaps

then decribe it
-- kubectl decribe configmaps course-config

so will get the all data inside of 01-configmap.yaml

so big question is---- how to these configmap.yaml refers to env.yaml file inside of folders
in Pods folder we have 06-env.yaml file and env data as cpoied in 07-pods-configmap.yaml is example how to refer

spec:
  containers:
    - name: env-demo-container
      image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
      env:
        - name: course
          valueFrom:
            ConfigMapKeyRef:
              name: kubernates-demo
              key: course
        - name: durarion
          valueFrom:
            ConfigMapKeyRef:
              name: kubernates-demo
              key: duration


in above syntax we refer the configmap to env 

after this we need to cd pods and kubectl apply -f 07-pods-config.yaml to run
it wil create the pods then copy pods go inside of the pods

kubectl exec -it pods [name of pod] -- bash
then type:
  -- #env 

  it will display

  now imagine if we have lost of configmap file like thousands of env its look ugly
  in this situion we have direct referece from env to congi.yaml file
  jsu replace:
    envFrom:
     - configMapRef:
        name: [give metadata name]


in configmap we only use the name od db_host and schema like that we never use the keys password like this

we created a secert folder it for only confidentail information only we use like keys, password etc..

in secert we have type: Opaque  --> Opaque means no one can see the keys

so lets say i need to encode my name 
type --> echo -n padmaravi | base64   --> it give some alphabet  --> this is username  --> after encode --> Ywqqrx
for password: echo -n padmaravi12 | base64  --> it give some alphabet --> this password -->after encode ---> Weriysqshj
then paste in 


then git pull --> cd secert --> kubectl apply -f 01-secert.yaml --> pod created 
--> kubectl decribe secert mysecret
 it will show the data as bytes

 then question how to refer this secert into pods , so iam crating file name 08-pod-secert.yaml
 then git pull --> cd pods --> kubectl apply -f 08-pods-secert.yaml
 -- then go inside of pod kubectl exec -it secert-pods -- bash
  then type env

  at run time kubernates refers the secert file it give the username and password


  ----very imp topic is services:
    -- kubectl get pods -o wide --> is to get all ip address of pods
    -- to decode any of alphabet key type --> echo -n [alphabet-key] | base64 --decode  ->> it give the value of alphabet-key like --> padmaravi

now go to 5.md file a brief explaniation of services
