this is about services--

why we use services-- services is act as a load balancer of pods if we have multiple pods as 2 types user pods how do we connect 
to we web for example we create services in middile f web and user connection then we connect services to 
user and users or anyother the we connect to web..

-- in service folder we have 01-service.yaml file we have multiple pods over there
how do we have connect them using of lebel in u=yaml file and selector in yaml file

--  kubectl apply -f 01-services.yaml


pod/nginx created
service/nginx-service created
pod/debug created

-- kubectl get services


[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubectl get services

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubectl exec -it debug -- bash   ## in debug we have called service name as ngnix-service

 kubectl get svc
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$


in yaml file we created a lot pods but e cewated only one service as a load balancer!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In service we have 3 type:

 1 --> cluster IP   -> its purely internal to cluster IP
 2 --> NodePort --> this can be act as expose the port of node to access the outside of cluster ->> a user can 
 acess the web in internet: just created 02-service-nodeport.yaml
