this is about services--

why we use services-- services is act as a load balancer of pods if we have multiple pods as 2 types user pods how do we connect 
to we web for example we create services in middile f web and user connection then we connect services to 
user and users or anyother the we connect to web..

-- in service folder we have 01-service.yaml file we have multiple pods over there
how do we have connect them using of lebel in u=yaml file and selector in yaml file

--  kubectl apply -f 01-services.yaml

 kubectl get svc
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.100.0.1      <none>        443/TCP   26m
nginx-service   ClusterIP   10.100.151.71   <none>        80/TCP    3m22s
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$


in yaml file we created a lot pods but e cewated only one service as a load balancer!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In service we have 3 type:

 1 --> cluster IP   -> its purely internal to cluster IP
 2 --> NodePort --> this can be act as expose the port of node to access the outside of cluster ->> a user can 
 acess the web in internet: just created 02-service-nodeport.yaml

 after kubectl apply -f 02-servicenodeport.yaml

 kubectl get svc
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.100.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        43m
nginx-service   NodePort    10.100.182.215   <none>        80:32172/TCP   19s
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$

in this service will create default of cluster IP 

if we observe the port in type: nodeport we have ports opened in 80:32172   -->
so -- kubectl get service -o wide

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubectl get svc -o wide
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE     SELECTOR
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.100.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        45m     <none>
nginx-service   NodePort    10.100.182.215   <none>        80:32172/TCP   2m57s   server=nginx
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP               NODE                            NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx   1/1     Running   0          3m11s   192.168.21.137   ip-192-168-6-234.ec2.internal   <none>           <none>
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$


observe carfully the ip-192-168-6-234 spot instance copy this ip open in putty then copy
the public ip addres ip then paste in browser and along with port


the browser keep on Running but response is coming there is problem in securty group go to the publice address 
of ip instance then click on securty group we we check inbound its only opent 22 so added a new rule with allow all with all tcp with custom 0.0.0.0./0 
save the inbound rule

now hit the browser again its works well, there service which allow the other public ip and node1 port addres its works well
user--> nodeport

now we have type 3 service: 

 --> That is LOADBALANCER
   loadbalance is only works with clouds --> like --> aws, gcp, azure

   so now we created a 03-loadbalancer.yaml file in type we just replaced with ad type: LoadBalancer

   [ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubectl apply -f 03-loadbalancer.yaml
pod/nginx created
service/nginx-service created
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubrctl get pods
-bash: kubrctl: command not found
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          21s
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$ kubectl get svc

kubernetes      ClusterIP      10.100.0.1       <none>                                                                    443/TCP        63m
nginx-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.242.120   a911d91907a664070b4e67958227e9d6-1901296062.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:30215/TCP   28s
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-89-161 services]$


after this we can check on aws instacne as load balancer it will created with above port and a91 like this

now take the dns name copy and paste in browser

DNS name
a911d91907a664070b4e67958227e9d6-1901296062.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
