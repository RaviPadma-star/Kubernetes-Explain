this is about services--

why we use services-- services is act as a load balancer of pods if we have multiple pods as 2 types user pods how do we connect 
to we web for example we create services in middile f web and user connection then we connect services to 
user and users or anyother the we connect to web..

-- in service folder we have 01-service.yaml file we have multiple pods over there
how do we have connect them using of lebel in u=yaml file and selector in yaml file

--  kubectl apply -f 01-services.yaml


pod/nginx created
service/nginx-service created
pod/debug created

-- kubectl get services
