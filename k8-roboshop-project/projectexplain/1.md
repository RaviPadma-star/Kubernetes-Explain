lets create a folde k8 then
lets build first the docker file and push to docker hub

cd k8-project

--> docker build -t padmaravi/web:k8 .

then-->  docker push padmaravi/web:k8

now its pushed to docker hub--> now we need to build the kubernates manifest file

 need to be access outside of internet.

 in manifest file what ever we give as labels the same we need to give on pod service inside of selector and targetport is ntg
 but container port
