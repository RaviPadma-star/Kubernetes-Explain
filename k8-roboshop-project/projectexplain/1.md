lets create a folde k8 then
lets build first the docker file and push to docker hub

cd k8-project

--> docker build -t padmaravi/web:k8 .

then-->  docker push padmaravi/web:k8

now its pushed to docker hub--> now we need to build the kubernates manifest file

 so i created a pod with ngnix manifest file andlso i have to create service beacuse its
 need to be access outside of internet.

 in manifest file what ever we give as labels the same we need to give on pod service inside of selector and targetport is ntg
 but container port

 ------------------------this is pod---------------
 apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web
  labels:
    name: web-service
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: webcontainer
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      image: padmaravi/web:k8
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "100m"
          memory: "128Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "100m"
          memory: "128Mi"
      ports:
        containerPort: 80

-------------------------this is service as loadbalance----------------

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-nginx-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    name: web-service
    tier: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
----------------------------------------------------

now git pull --->
-->  kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
