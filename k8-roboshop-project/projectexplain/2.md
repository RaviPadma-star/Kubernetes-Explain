after creating catalogue we have createed a config maps in manifest file insteasd of hardcoding we use confg maps
then now we have to create mysql 
in mysql we have env varibale for this we can congif this!

now let us create a manifest file under the mysql 
then first create a pod defination and service defination as well

then we need to config the env as config defination in manifest file 
remember username and passwards are keeo in secrets and for user and passwards we need to give as base 64

--> echo -n shipping | base64

after doing above encoding

then we need to give the reference of configmap from config pods under the image
envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: catalogue-config
        
and also for secrets key we need to give fron secrets defination
secretKeyRef
