Dynamic Provising:
------------------

we dont create pv, we dont create a storage

every thing is handle by pvc.

steps to create Dynamic Provising:

1. we will install drivers for ex: ebs drivers
2. we will create storage class for ebs

----------------------------
install efs drivers
create a storage

pvc, pod

efs - is elastic file system 

go to aws and search for efs and click on create 
after creating the efs then for spot instance we need to add permission as elasticfilesystemfullcaccess

Node Selectors
--------------
lets say we have 3 nodes or 2 nodes

when applying the --> eks randomly select the nodes
but we want apply a pod to specific node we need SELECTORS

for selector we need to apply as labels

--> kubectl get nodes  ---> you will get node and cpy any of node
--> kubectl label nodes [node-address] teir=web 
--> kubectl get nodes --show-labels

created a folder with scheduler  and 01-node-selector.yaml in this --> we need to apply pod for specific node we can key value pair
as teir=web for this same in yaml give nodeselector:
                                            teir=web

git push -- git pull cd scheduler --> kubectl apply -f 01-node-selector.yaml 

    --kubectl get nodes
    --kubectl get pods -o wide --> we can match with node address

--> node affinity is important lot of nodes runinng to specifiv attach a pod to nodes
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:

we have In and Notin operators use to specifc pod go node
kubectl label nodes [node-address] teir=app 


Pod affinity:
-------------

cart is calling catalouge 
if both pods are in same node the responce time is very less.

so for example catalouge is running on one node --> so we want cart pod aslo be runn on same node where catalouge is running
so here we have to carefully match labels of metadata labels name with cart pods labelselector 

anti-affinity:
-------------
if catalouge is running on some node but i dont want to run a cart on catalouge running node

Taints and Tolerations:
-----------------------
taint is nothing but paint 
if you taint  a node, you dont want any pods on that node
out of 3 nodes taint  one node, by default  scheduler will not  schedule any pod in this
but we want DB pods in this node. for this we should use Tolerations

created a file name taints and toleartion 
this concept is used for securty purpose means we attach a db to onlly single node for specific 

-- kubectl get nodes --> copy the any of node address
-- attach to db like --> kubectl taint nodes [copy of node address] tier=DB:NoSchedule


thats it see 5.ms file RBAC important topic..
