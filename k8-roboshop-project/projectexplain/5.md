This all abot RBAC impotant topic..

RBAC --> Role Based Access Control

--> how can access the resource  -> what ever is discuued topic are admin access
but in real time we dont grt admin access..
there will be a EKS adminstarters
and we are project team for examaple we have roboshop project..
similarly in eks cluster we so many projects running but we need controll access for only roboshop

steps:
1.admin will create EKS ckuster
2. he will created a Namespace by admin

Role  -> admins will create role for us
RoleBinding --> they will bind the role with permission

authentication and auterisation   -> eks-aws

authentication will be handled by AWS IAM
Authorization will handled by EKS cluster

1. we need to create IAM user that can have authentication to eks cluster
    --> go to IAm user add user--> give name roboshop-admin now permission attach policy
    click on create a policy--> in serach as eks click on it below that select access level as
    --> list and read
    --> in below resources click on add arn select region as any and  clustername: copy the cluster name in eks

    after adding click on add and click on next tag review the plociy name it as eksclusterreadpolicy then click on create policy

    after created policy in attach policy check the policy name we created select it then click on next then created a user..

    remember it is only for authentication pusrpose for Authorization is different


Authorization : it from eks cluster side

user
role
binding

we have api-groups
resource belong to api-groups
actions of resource --< create. read, update, delete
here in this we have something like verbs --> get, watch, list, create, update, delete. patch

api-groups is [''] means all resource
so have created a folder called rbac then file name 01-rbac.yaml in this
first create a Namespace, then role and then RoleBinding and attach role to RoleBinding

in server --< cd rbac --> kubectl apply -f 01-rbac.yaml --> kubectl get ns, --> kubectl get roles, kubectl get roles -n roboshop,
kubectl get rolesbinding -n roboshop

so by default eks cluster not identify the IAM user, for this we need to extra thing to authentication
there is when ever we create cluster by default cluster will create a configmaps

-- to get the confgi-map of aws
--> kubectl get configmap aws-auth -n kubesystem -o yaml 

copied that reposne from server created a file 02-aws-auth.yaml   --> go to google serach for aws-auth for eks cluster then 
mapsuser:
    user: #copy arn form eks-admin which we created as roboshop
    - userarn: arn:aws:iam::752692907119:user/roboshop-admin
      username: roboshop-admin
    - userarn: arn:aws:iam::752692907119:user/ramesh
      username: ramesh
    - userarn: arn:aws:iam::752692907119:user/suresh
      username: suresh

> kubectl apply -f 02-aws-auth.yaml
-> kubectl get configmap aws-auth -n kubesystem -o yaml # here we can see the mapusers

now he will mails us admins like-->
iam user created
robosdhop namespace created
roboshop admin role created
attached IAM roboshop admin user to the roboshop admin role
configured aws-auth to add IAM user to EKS cluster

now go head and use your IAM user

now what we have to do is go to robshop admin where it created and click on security-credentials tab--> click on create access
click on command line click next -> create access key


lets take duplicate instance --> cd .kube/
--> vim config  -> we can see all cluster information if we see under name we are accessing the eks-admin

then cd
-> aws config --> if we check these are the old access of eks admin credentials -->

so in new instance type aws configure with lastest keys 
to access our eks-cluster --> we have some commands
seracg in goole --> aws eks-update-kubeconfig for a normal user
 server--> ls -l
 --> aws sts get-caller-identity will get responce with name mysuer-roboshop-admin
 --> aws eks update-kubeconfig --region region-code --name my-cluster
 --> aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name eks-cluster //it say addes arn

 then go and check >> cd .kube/
 --> vim config

 then cd ..
 --> kubectl get nodes --> it gives error because we are now specific to our user
 --> kubectl get pods --> it gives error because we are now specific to our user

 --> kubectl get pods -n roboshop  # now it gives the pods if we created
 --> lets check wheather it creting pod are not ..
 --> vim pod.yaml  -> copy and paste the simple pod defination
  -- then kubectl apply -f pod.yaml -> it will not create because we ddint given namespace name in pod yaml 
  --> so add metadata: 
                name: nginx
                Namespace: roboshop
--> so now apply again kubectl apply -f pod.yaml --> then it created a pod
