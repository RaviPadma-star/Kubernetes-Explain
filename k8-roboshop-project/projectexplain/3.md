so we are config the application i am getting some serror i changes some of code in nginx file 
of default.config of web file..

in real time dont use spot instance 
some we need to remove cache means
 -- docker build --no-cache -t padmaravi/web .

 and main while 
 location /api/ratings/ {
        proxy_pass http://ratings:80/;
    }

    we never forget the / after the :80

    note: for rabbit mq need to search for ports they are two ports so we need to mention in manifest file

    after dooing the all config of roboshop!! its a basic termes of kubernated..

    so every time we deleting and creating the pods making issue so for that overcome these we have
    replicasets..
    these will do replica the pods how much we set

    then created a folder called name with replicasets and under that 01-replicasets.ymal file
    in server gp anf cd replicasets and kubetctl apply -f 01-replicaset.yaml

    [ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-63 replicasets]$ kubectl apply -f 01-replicaset.yaml
replicaset.apps/nginx created
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-63 replicasets]$ p

nginx-kfms6   1/1     Running   0          4s


    [ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-63 replicasets]$ 
    -- kubectl get replicaset

NAME    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx   3         3         3       43s
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-63 replicasets]$


-------------
nginx-57r45

podname = [replicaset-name]-[random-name]

when ever suddelenly we delete the pod means its automatically create another pod with light speed when set as replica

---------------
now main thing is deplyement comes in kubernates what it does it automaitcally update the latest image when its availbale

--rolling update is nothing but zero downtime of application and also new update should be happen
so when there is deplyemt Running with old and latest some disadvatg\age will ber there to overcome these type we have
rolling update startegy in kubernates

strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 2 # we asked for 10, we are okay if 9 are running at the time of upgrade
      maxSurge: 2 # we asked for 10, we are okay at the time of upgrade 11 are running
